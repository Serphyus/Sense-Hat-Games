<h2 align="center">Sense HAT Games</h2>

This is a project dedicated to creating old classic games to be run on the
raspberry pi Sense HAT add-on for fun. All the games in this repository takes
advantage of the Sense HAT add-on's 8x8 RGB pixel grid and the joystick mod.
These games can additionally be tested by modifying the sense_hat import
to sense_emu but take note that due to this module using GTK it can not be
used for testing from a windows machine.
